# Design Pattern used by MVC (Model View Controller)

The reason for using the mvc design pattern:
- from what I learned using the mvc design pattern it's easier to do testing, and the testing I've ever done is unit testing using jest
- find bugs or errors faster because all logic is in one controllers folder

# Tools used
- ORM sequelize: to generate database
- PostgreSQL : database
- Nodemon : to run the server
- JsonWebToken : to get response token
- bcrypt : for password hashing
